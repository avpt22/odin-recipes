                When the ingredients are room temperatured, 
                then it's easier to avoid lumps when you are adding the jelly powder.
            </li>
            <li>Put the biscuits, sugar and cinnamon in a blender or foodprosessor unil
                the biscuits are crushed. 
            </li>
            <li>Melt butter and add to the biscuit mixture</li>
            <li>Dress the bottom of a springform pan (24 cm in diameter) with baking
                 paper and press the biscuit mixture down. Leave in the fridge for 
                an hour to cool down. </li>
                <li>Warm up water and add the jelly powder until mixed.</li>
                <li>Mix sourcream and creamcheese in a bowl. Add sugar powder and vanilla suger.

                <li>Whip heavy whipping cream until you get a airy and soft cream. 
                    Put the cream into the cheese curd with a spatula to keep most of the air. 
                </li>
                <li>Check the jelly's temperature. It shouldn't be too varm. Mix the
